Movie recommendation system The project "movie recommendation system" basically recommends movies for the user. This project is designed to help us understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. We will be developing an Item Based Collaborative Filter. Recommender systems open new opportunities of retrieving personalized information on the Internet. We come up with a strategy that focuses on dealing with userâ€™s personal interests and based on his previous reviews, movies are recommended to users. This strategy helps in improving accuracy of the recommendations. A personal profile is created for each user, where each user has access to his own history, his likes, ratings, comments, password modification processes.
